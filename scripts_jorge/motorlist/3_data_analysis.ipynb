      "The 1.5-liter BMW B38 3-cylinder engine series has been assembled since 2013 and is installed on cars with front-wheel drive like B38A15, rear-wheel drive like B38B15 and hybrids like B38K15. Also, these units are installed on the Mini: 1.2-liter B38A12A and 1.5-liter B38A15A.B38 gasoline engines made their debut as part of the i8 coupe hybrid power plant, but conventional modifications soon appeared. By design, there is an aluminum block with plasma-sprayed steel and a closed jacket, an aluminum 12-valve cylinder head equipped with hydraulic lifters and direct fuel injection, Vanos phase shifters on both camshafts, plus a Valvetronic system and a timing chain drive. The engine is supercharged by a single water-cooled Continental turbocharger. It should also be noted the presence of a balancing shaft and a Bosch MEVD 17.2.3 control unit.B38A15U0: 102 hp, 180 Nm. The engine was installed on:B38A15U1: 109 hp, 190 Nm. The engine was installed on:B38A15M0: 136 hp, 220Nm. The engine was installed on:B38A15M1: 140 hp, 220 Nm. The engine was installed on:B38B15U0: 109 hp, 180 Nm. The engine was installed on:B38B15M0: 136 hp, 220 Nm. The engine was installed on:B38K15T0: 231 hp, 320 Nm. The engine was installed on:- BMW 2-Series F45 in 2015 – 2018; - BMW 2-Series F46 in 2015 – 2018.- Engines until 2015 suffered from excessive axial clearance on the crankshaft and the thrust bearing collapsed at 50,000 km. And then the design was finalized. - The aluminum casing of the water-cooled turbine here is integral with the exhaust manifold and cracks from overheating, which leads to leakage of antifreeze. - Like all engines with direct fuel injection, the intake valves are overgrown with soot, which results in floating rpm and unstable operation of the power unit. - Weaknesses also include not the most durable catalyst and adsorber valve. Also, at high mileage, failures in the VANOS and Valvetronic systems are often encountered.\n",
      "A series of 2.0-liter BMW B48 gasoline engines has been produced by the company since 2014 and is installed on almost the entire modern model range of the German automaker. Two versions of the motor differ: B48A20 – for cars with front-wheel drives and B48B20 – with rear ones.BMW B48 gasoline engines began to replace their counterparts in the N20 family from 2014. There is direct fuel injection, an aluminum cylinder block with a closed cooling jacket and plasma spraying in the cylinders, an aluminum 16-valve cylinder head with hydraulic lifters, equipped with a Valvetronic system, a timing chain drive, and Vanos-type phase shifters on the intake and exhaust camshafts. Also, among the features of the unit, we note a pair of gear-driven balance shafts, an intercooler integrated into the intake manifold, a controlled thermostat, a Bosch MG1 ECU and a Twin Scroll MHI TD04LR6W turbine with a separate cooling circuit, radiator and pump.In 2018, an updated modification of the unit appeared, which is usually called the B48TU. The new engines received a lightweight crankshaft, a different auxiliary equipment drive, an exhaust manifold built into the head of the block, injection pressure increased to 350 bar, an upgraded cooling system, a simplified timing drive with one chain instead of two, and a more modern Bosch DME 8th generation electronic engine control unit.All modifications of power units are divided into two large sections according to the type of drive.B48A20U1: 178 hp, 280 Nm, compression ratio 11.0. The engine was installed on:B48A20M0: 192 hp, 280 Nm, compression ratio 11.0. The engine was installed on:B48A20M1: 192 hp, 280 Nm, compression ratio 11.0. The engine was installed on:B48A20O0: 231 hp, 350 Nm, compression ratio 10.2. The engine was installed on:B48A20T1: 306 hp, 450 Nm, compression ratio 9.5. The engine was installed on:B48B20U1: 156 hp, 250 Nm, compression ratio 11.0. The engine was installed on:B48B20M0: 184 hp, 290 Nm, compression ratio 11.0. The engine was installed on:B48B20M1: 184 hp, 300 Nm, compression ratio 11.0. The engine was installed on:* on the Z4 model, this motor develops 197 hp, 320 Nm.B48B20O0: 252 hp, 350 Nm, compression ratio 10.2. The engine was installed on:* on the 125i model, this motor develops 224 hp, 310 Nm.B48B20O1: 258 hp, 400 Nm, compression ratio 10.2. The engine was installed on:* on X5 and X6 models, this motor develops 265 hp, 400 Nm.- BMW 1-Series F40 since 2020; - BMW 2-Series F44 since 2020; 2-Series F45 in 2020 – 2021; 2-Series F46 since 2020; - BMW X1 F48 since 2020; - BMW X2 F39 since 2020.- Compared to their predecessors, the B48 series engines are no longer so prone to oil consumption, however, closer to 100,000 km, valve stem seals often tan and consumption appears. - Floating idle speed or the regular occurrence of lean mixture errors hint at the failure of the fuel tank ventilation valve. But it is inexpensive. - In 2019, a recall campaign was carried out to replace defective B48 series motors. It was a defect in the needle bearings that support the balancers. - These units are demanding on the quality of the fuel used and the frequency of oil changes, and the savings often turn into extremely expensive repairs or engine replacements.\n",
      "A series of 6-cylinder BMW B58B30 engines with a volume of 3.0 liters has been assembled in Munich since 2015 and put on charged modifications of rear- and all-wheel drive models of the German concern. There are two generations of such engines and the line of S58 sports units created on their basis.B58 are engines with an aluminum block and plasma sprayed steel on the cylinder walls, an aluminum 24-valve cylinder head with hydraulic lifters, a direct fuel injection system, Vanos phase shifters on two camshafts, a Valvetronic system and a timing chain drive. These engines are supercharged by a Mahle/Bosch twin-scroll turbocharger with an intercooler. It is also worth noting that, unlike the B38 and B48 units, there are no balancing shafts here.In 2018, an updated version appeared, known in the technical literature as B58B30TU. This power unit is distinguished by a simplified timing drive with one chain instead of two previously, a lightweight crankshaft, a new injection system with pressure increased from 200 to 350 bar, and an exhaust manifold built into the block head. As a result, the weight decreased by 6 kg.There are three families of such motors, with B58B30M1 and B58B30O1 called B58B30TU.B58B30M0 (326 – 340 hp / 450 – 500 Nm) engine was installed on:B58B30M1 (333 – 340 hp / 450 – 500 Nm) engine was installed on:B58B30O1 (360 – 374 hp / 500 Nm) engine was installed on:- BMW 1-Series F20 in 2016 – 2019; - BMW 2-Series F22 in 2016 – 2021; - BMW 3-Series F30 in 2015 – 2018; 3-Series F34 in 2016 – 2020; - BMW 4-Series F32 in 2016 – 2021; - BMW 5-Series G30 in 2017 – 2020; - BMW 6-Series G32 in 2017 – 2020; - BMW 7-Series G11 in 2015 – 2018.- Most of the complaints on the specialized forums are related to a decrease in the coolant level. The exact cause is unknown, but sometimes replacing the expansion tank cap helps. - It’s a pretty hot engine and blows head gaskets regularly. Usually, a strong smell of burnt oil appears immediately, and often smoke. - Like most gasoline direct injection engines, B58 engines often suffer from floating engine speeds due to carbon deposits on the intake valves. - Rarer problems here are related to the Vanos phase shifters, the canister valve and the oil filter, which falls apart when replaced, and it is not so easy to get it.\n",
      "The first car with an M20 engine was the BMW E12 520/6, which was fitted with a 2-liter M20B20 modification. The cylinder diameter is 80 mm, the piston stroke is 66 mm. The M20B20 engine was first equipped with a Bosch L-Jetronic injector in 1982 on a BMW 520i. In 1987 it was updated using a Bosch Motronic catalytic converter system.When using M20B20 engines, they face wear on the camshaft, overheating, and violation of the integrity of the cylinder head.The cylinder head can move when overheated. To avoid cylinder head failure, at the first sign of overheating, you need to check the health of the cooling system. The system is checked for air pockets, which are removed by blowing. It is also necessary to assess the condition of the thermostat, pump and radiator.Cylinder head may crack due to engine overheating. Often a crack occurs in the area of ​​the 4-5 cylinder; the problem can be eliminated by replacing the part.The condition of the timing belt and the location of the tensioner roller should be carefully monitored in order to avoid belt breakage, valve bending, piston breakage.For motors with a range of 200 thousand kilometers or more, camshaft wear is characteristic, which is determined by a knock. To solve the problem, a new cylinder head is installed.\n",
      "The M20B25 – 2.5 liter engine without catalytic converter. It was originally released with a carburetor, and over time it was equipped with a fuel injection system – Bosch. The engine management system was used by Bosch Motronic 1.1/1.3. In 1987, the B25 was upgraded after which the capacity was increased.In 1987, a catalyzed model with Motronic 1.3 engine management was introduced. The compression ratio was reduced to 8.8:1 but thanks to the more sophisticated electronics power remained nearly as before, at 125 kW (170 PS; 168 hp). The uncatalyzed engine was kept in production for Southern Europe and other markets where unleaded petrol was not regularly available.In the M20B25 unit, the condition of the timing belt and the condition of its tensioner roller also needs a thorough inspection. If the belt breaks, the valve bends cannot be avoided, and sometimes even the complete destruction of the pistons. As they age (it should be borne in mind that they have been produced since 1986), the engines of this series exhibit characteristic aging defects. For this reason, buying a car equipped with this unit is not a very promising undertaking, in terms of its trouble-free further service.\n",
      "The M30B30 engine is the 3.0-liter (2986 cc) version of the M30 engine. The fuel injected version of the 2,986 cc (182.2 cu in) M30 debuted in 1971 in the E9 3.0 CSi and initially used the Bosch D-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system. In 1976, the fuel injection system was upgraded to Bosch L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection. The M30B30 produces up to 147 kW (200 PS; 197 bhp) and 272 Nm (200 lb⋅ft), depending on the model year and whether a catalytic converter is fitted. The compression ratio is 9.2:1. With catalytic converter, compression ratio is 9:1.The main problems of BMW M30B30 engines are overheating and cracks in the cylinder block. Overheating is experienced by many owners of 6-cylinder vehicles. In order not to drive the cylinder head, this problem must be solved in a timely manner and not started. The motor overheats due to a dirty pump, radiator, thermostat, in the presence of air jams in the cooling system of the unit.Cracks occur after disassembling the motor, when oil is not removed from the threaded wells. They form around the threads of the cylinder head bolts. If you notice an increased consumption of antifreeze, the presence of an emulsion in the oil, this may indicate cracks in the cylinder block. Sometimes they try to solve the problem by repairing, but the masters recommend buying and installing a cylinder block without cracks.Due to their long service life, BMW M30B30 engines have problems in the gas distribution mechanism when the valve cannot be adjusted. The solution is to replace eccentrics, bushings and valves.Problems may affect the mass air flow sensor, since the resource of the units has been outleted, including due to intensive, often aggressive operation.\n",
      "The M30B34 engines sold in Europe and most other markets had a compression ratio of 10.0:1 and produced 160 kW (218 hp). In North America and Japan, the M30B34 had an 8.0:1 compression ratio and produced 136 kW (185 hp). All markets used the Bosch Motronic digital fuel injection system. The bore is 92 mm (3.62 in) and the stroke is 86 mm (3.39 in).The M30B35 engine has a displacement of 3430 cc (209.3 cu in), despite the “B35” model code. It produces 155 kW (211 hp) at 5700 rpm and 305 Nm (225 lb⋅ft) at 4000 rpm, has a compression ratio of 9.0:1 and uses Bosch Motronic 1.3 digital fuel injection. It was also offered without a catalytic converter for some markets; this version develops 162 kW (220 hp) and 315 Nm (232 lb-ft) at the same engine speed.Not to be confused with theM30B35LEengine, which has a different cylinder block geometry.Overheating is a common problem in BMW M30B35 engines. It is better not to allow such a situation, so as not to drive the cylinder head. A dirty radiator or pump, thermostat can provoke overheating. Quite often the cause is the plugs in the cooling mechanism.Owners of cars with a BMW M30B35 engine may encounter cracks in the cylinder block that form around the threads of the cylinder head bolts. Damage occurs due to disassembly of the unit, as well as when oil is not removed from the threads. The presence of cracks is indicated by the rapid consumption of antifreeze when an emulsion appears in the oil. Sometimes they decide to resort to repairs, but it is advisable to buy and install the cylinder block without damage.Due to long-term operation, motors have problems in regulating the valve of the gas distribution mechanism. In this case, the installation of new eccentrics, guide bushings and valves is required. Due to the impressive age of the engine, malfunctions of the mass air flow sensor may appear.\n",

It uses the same block as the M88 and the same bore and stroke, but the cylinder head is borrowed from the BMW M30 engine family. Over the years, both Bosch Motronic and Bosch L-Jetronic engine management systems have been used in this engine. Usually identified by a white L on the block behind the oil filter housing and coolant passages on the side of the block.Since it was sold in Europe and most other markets (except North America), it had a compression ratio of 9.3:1, had no catalytic converter, and produced 160 kW (218 hp).Not to be confused with theM30B34 and M30B35engines, which differ in cylinder block geometry.The engine was installed on:\n",

Each problem has its own reasons.- Engine knocking can be caused by wear on the camshaft, hydraulic lifters and rocker arms. The condition of the parts must be checked. - Floating rpm arise due to a breakdown of the mass air flow sensor, there may be an air leak. Carefully inspect the engine, check the mass air flow sensor, assess the condition of the idle valve and the throttle valve, check the lambda probe.

In 2004, BMW presented the world with a new line of N52 engines, which smoothly began to replace the M54 line. In 2006, the M54B30 engine completely left the production line. But in 2006, on the basis of the M54, one of the most successful BMW N54 turbocharged engines was created, which was massively installed on cars with the 35i index.To the problems can be added the death of the camshaft status sensors, poor threads for mounting the cylinder block, sensitivity to oil quality, a low resource and a short-lived thermostat. Nevertheless, the M54 is more reliable than the M52. Therefore, the M54B30 is reliable, strong and well suited for swaping.\n",

      "BMW N42B18 engines are in-line 4-cylinder engines with DOHC gas distribution system. The predecessor of this unit model was the M43 series engines. The main feature of the N42B18 is the two overhead camshafts and the innovative VANOS system. This technology made it possible to reduce fuel consumption and reduce outlet gas pollution. And Valvetronic technology contributes to increased power by optimizing the cylinder filling with the mixture.You also need to take into account that when changing spark plugs, the coils of the BREMI ignition system often deteriorate. It is better to change the latter to EPA. The N42’s powertrain loves good oils. It is better to pour only the one recommended by the manufacturer itself. The engine has a high heating temperature, and saving on oil, as a rule, leads to the need for overhaul. Often it will be necessary to replace the vanos as well.The motor is quite economical and functional, however, it is also very capricious (it needs to be constantly monitored), and not as reliable as its predecessors, that is, the M40-M43.\n",

The engine has a direct fuel injection system.When operating the BMW N43B16 engine, there are problems with floating rpm and vibration.If the injectors need to be replaced, vibration occurs in the motor. It is necessary to check the condition of the injectors and replace them in a timely manner. If the engine vibrates and floating speed is noticeable, the problem may be in the failed ignition coils. They should be checked and replaced.After about 80 thousand kilometers, the vacuum pump becomes unusable, the part needs to be replaced. It is also recommended to regularly check the condition of the cooling system to prevent overheating of the power unit.Owners of a car with a BMW N43B16 engine should take into account that the unit works well on high-quality working fluids. If you save on oil, you can face the problem of engine overhaul. Better to use the oil recommended by BMW.

      "The BMW N43B20 engine is a 4-cylinder inline gasoline unit produced by BMW from 2007 to 2011. There are three versions of the N43 engine, which have gained popularity and recognition among motorists around the world.Unlike its predecessor, the N42 engine, the new BMW N43 engine features direct fuel injection and Valvetronic valve lift systems. The engine was produced in conjunction with such units as N45 and N46, however, in terms of demand, it surpassed its followers in this period of time.This engine has been designed to achieve an optimally high level of torque combined with economy and environmental friendliness – a combination that is not always easy to achieve.The cooling system always needs to be checked, otherwise it is easy to overheat. In addition, the power unit of this series is quite demanding on oil and fuel. Oil requires particularly careful quality control. High-temperature operation of the engine will immediately lead to the deterioration of uncertified oil, which in the future will lead to big problems. Therefore, it is recommended to use only the oil recommended by the manufacturer for N43B20. Proper care and timely maintenance will make the engine run longer than its intended resource.\n",
      "The small 1.6-liter BMW N45B16 engine was developed in 2004 based on the predecessorN42B18. The new engine has a different crankshaft with a shorter piston stroke (it was 81, now 72 mm), different connecting rods and a modified piston. In addition, the Valvetronic valve lift system is not used on the N45B16.The cylinder head is covered with another cover, a new generator and candles are used. Engine management system Bosch ME 9.2. Since 2007, the engine has been updated, received a new Bosch ME17.4.5 control unit, and the letter N has been added to the name – N45NB16.This engine was used on BMW cars with an index of 16i. Along with this engine in the limited edition N45 series, a 2-liter sports version was also produced – theN45B20S.It should also be added that the power unit of this series can exhibit a detonation of the fuel mixture. The reason is the poor quality of fuel or oil. The latter should only be of the brand and series that the manufacturer himself advises to use – the BMW plant. Otherwise, the likelihood of developing big troubles is high – even a major overhaul is possible.\n",
      "In 2006, the N45 engine received a new modification – N45B20S with a displacement of 1997 cc. The N45B20S replaced theN42B20and was produced in a limited edition in 2006 specifically for the BMW 320si E90. In addition to improving technical characteristics, the main technological improvement of the engine was undoubtedly the use of the innovative Valvetronic system, which significantly increases the efficiency of the entire engine as a whole.Units of the N45 series also have another obvious drawback – the detonation of the fuel mixture. The problem arises from poor quality fuel or oil. The BMW manufacturer strongly discourages the use of any alternative engine oil, since the consequences can be very serious – it may be necessary to carry out major repairs to restore it.\n",

To avoid most of the engine malfunctions and to make it work harmoniously, like a good clockwork, you can, if you constantly monitor its condition, undergo maintenance on time and fill it with only good oils and fuel.\n",
      "The N52B25 is a 2.5-liter engine from the new N52 series (which includes theN52B30), with six cylinders in line. The N52B25 was introduced in 2005 as a replacement for the popularM54B25and unlike past evolutions of the M-family, this is now a completely new engine. The N52 is based on an even lighter magnesium-aluminum cylinder block, with a new lightweight connecting rod and piston group and a redesigned crankshaft.The N52B25 uses an updated cylinder head with the already familiar system for changing the valve timing on two shafts, or more simply, Double-VANOS. In addition, a Valvetronic valve lift change system was added, which increased output and fuel efficiency. The timing drive uses a chain, a DISA variable-length manifold is used at the inlet, the nozzles are installed in the cylinder head, the Siemens MSV70 engine management system.This motor was used on BMW cars with the index 23i and 25i.The main problems of the N52B25 engine are: increased oil consumption, ticking sounds, floating revs.High oil consumption is usually associated with oil scraper rings. They are very thin and coke quickly enough. The reason may be in the valve stem seals. The problem appears even before reaching the mark of 100 thousand kilometers. The condition of the system should be checked regularly and the rings and caps should be replaced. It is also recommended to check the condition of the crankcase ventilation valve.If you do not pay attention to the high oil consumption, the existing problem will lead to clogging of the catalysts. In this case, it will be necessary to supply new catalysts, which will be expensive, or use inexpensive flame arresters.When a ticking sound is heard in the engine, these are features of power units manufactured before 2009. This does not pose any danger to the unit.Floating revolutions occur due to a breakdown of the Valvetronic system, Vanos valves or a flow meter. If not properly maintained, the Vanos system can lead to problems. System failure is usually caused by the use of low-quality working fluids. To restore system operation, a flush is performed. If the problem persists, a replacement is required.If the engine overheats, check the condition of the cooling system, pump, cleanliness of the radiator. The pump needs to be changed every 100 thousand kilometers. The oil recommended by the manufacturer should be used.\n",

Injectors have now also moved to the cylinder head, a DISA variable-length manifold is used at the inlet, a Siemens MSV70 engine management system, a chain is used in the timing.The N52B30 engine was used on BMW cars with the 25i, 28i and 30i index, depending on the modification.- After 100,000 km, valve stem seals often tan here and oil burns appear; - The membrane of the crankcase ventilation valve also does not last long in this engine; - All this leads to gradual coking and further to unstable engine operation; - The cause of floating engine speeds is usually a malfunction of the Valvetronic or Vanos system; - Electrically, the oil level sensor is often buggy, which is fraught with oil starvation; - In power units of 2004 – 2009, hydraulic lifters clatter during a cold start.- After 100,000 km, valve stem seals often tan here and oil burns appear; - The membrane of the crankcase ventilation valve also does not last long in this engine; - All this leads to gradual coking and further to unstable engine operation; - The cause of floating engine speeds is usually a malfunction of the Valvetronic or Vanos system; - Electrically, the oil level sensor is often buggy, which is fraught with oil starvation; - In power units of 2004 – 2009, hydraulic lifters clatter during a cold start.\n",
      "The N53B25 inline 6-cylinder engine represents the N53 family (also includes theN53B30), developed on the basis of theN52B25and in 2007 was intended to replace the raw predecessor. The cylinder block remained the same with minimal changes, the pistons changed and the compression ratio increased to 12.The cylinder head with Double-VANOS was finalized, a direct fuel injection system appeared, and the Valvetronic valve lift change system disappeared. The engine control system has changed, now Siemens MSD81 is used instead of Siemens MSV70, otherwise the motor is the same. This motor was used on BMW cars with the 23i index.- Most of the problems with this unit are related to the direct fuel injection system. - From bad gasoline, piezoelectric injectors and their high pressure fuel pump quickly fail. - After a long stop, faulty injectors can cause water hammer in the motor. - Also, owners of cars with this engine often change spark plugs and ignition coils. - On runs over 100,000 km, the Vanos phase control system often requires repair.- Most of the problems with this unit are related to the direct fuel injection system. - From bad gasoline, piezoelectric injectors and their high pressure fuel pump quickly fail. - After a long stop, faulty injectors can cause water hammer in the motor. - Also, owners of cars with this engine often change spark plugs and ignition coils. - On runs over 100,000 km, the Vanos phase control system often requires repair.\n",

      "Especially for the BMW M5 E34 released in 1988, a new sports engine called the S38B36 was designed. The basis for this engine was the aspirated M88/3 (S38B35), with a colleague in the series,M30B34, S38 has less in common.A lightweight forged crankshaft with a piston stroke of 86 mm (was 84 mm) and 12 counterweights was installed in the M88/3 cylinder block. The cylinder diameter remained unchanged (93.4 mm), the pistons were modified, their compression height was 31.5 mm, and the compression ratio was 10, the length of the connecting rods was 144 mm.The cylinder head of the BMW S38 is a two-shaft 24-valve with mechanical pushers. Valve adjustment is carried out as necessary, cold clearances 0.28 / 0.33 mm. Camshaft parameters S38B36: phase 264/110, lift 10.7 mm. Intake valves are 37mm, exhaust 32mm. The intake has a variable geometry manifold and, of course, 6 throttles, one for each cylinder, the diameter of each throttle is 46 mm. The nozzles have a capacity of 270 cc.Control unit – Bosch Motronic M1.2. At the outlet, an equal-length collector is used. The timing drive uses a double-row chain, which is quite reliable.These innovations made it possible to remove the power of 316 hp at 6900 rpm.The main problems of the BMW S38 engine are cracks in the cylinder block, overheating. Cracks form around the threads for the cylinder head bolts. The reasons for the breakdown are oil that has not been removed from the thread, disassembly of the motor. The problem can be diagnosed by the high consumption of antifreeze, the appearance of an emulsion in the oil. The optimal solution is to replace it with a non-cracked block.If overheating occurs, the problem must be solved quickly so that the cylinder head does not move. Overheating occurs when a thermostat, radiator or pump needs cleaning, or when there is a blockage in the cooling system.Frequent malfunctions include wear of the elements of the gas distribution system, the complexity and inability to adjust the valve. To solve the problem, eccentrics, guide bushings and valves are changed. Poor performance may be related to the MAF. During the warming up of the car, a whistle is heard, there are frequent leaks of the rear crankshaft oil seal.\n",
      "The BMW S38B38 engine appeared in 1992 and was developed on the basis of theS38B36: a crankshaft with a piston stroke of 90 mm and with 12 counterweights was used, connecting rods were 142.5 mm long, the cylinder diameter was increased to 94.6 mm, new lightweight pistons with a compression height of 30.7 mm, the compression ratio increased to 10.5, and the working volume reached 3.8 liters.The S38 cylinder head was also modified: the intake valves increased in diameter to 38.5 mm, the exhaust valves to 32.5 mm, and the intake and exhaust channels were finalized. The camshafts on the S38B38 are 264/108, 10.7mm lift. The intake manifold has been redesigned, the throttle bodies have increased in diameter to 50 mm. The release is also new, the control unit is Bosch Motronic DME 3.3.All this made it possible to improve the behavior of the car at low and medium speeds and increase power to 340 hp at 6900 rpm.Among the impressive list of breakdowns, the likelihood of cracks in the cylinder block in the unit stands out. The formation of cracks occurs near the threads where the cylinder block bolts are fixed. The presence of oil in the thread, as well as frequent disassembly of the unit, provokes the appearance of such a breakdown. This breakdown is easy to spot. Its presence is immediately reflected in an increase in the consumption of antifreeze and the presence of an emulsion in the oil. The only option that allows you to get rid of this breakdown is to install a new unit.The s38b38 motor overheats only in three situations. Clogged radiator, pump or thermostat. Sometimes this trouble occurs in the event of a plug in the cooling system.Lack of crankshaft operation during engine start. The failure of the starter, poor fastening of the terminal, or disconnection of the ground bus present on the engine body can provoke the appearance of this breakdown;\n",
      "The basic 3-liter version of the M3 sedan, coupe and convertible sports engine produced for the European market (S50B30 EU) since 1992. In 1994, this 300 hp engine was installed in a limited edition M3 GTR E36 coupe, and a year later the M3 GT E36 racing model was equipped with a 295 hp version of this unit, with a torque of 324 Nm.Also in 1995, BMW Motorsport and Schnitzer Motorsport GmbH upgraded this power unit for the Australian racing version of the M3-R E36 coupe.Typical malfunctions of the S50B30 engine include: increased oil consumption, overheating, leaks, floating speed, problems with the Vanos system, intake air leaks.The motor is prone to overheating. If you notice a problem, you need to check the operation of the cooling system: radiator, thermostat, pump. Overheating can be caused by air blockages in the system and broken radiator caps.Unstable turnovers are often caused by a failed idle valve. After cleaning the valve, operation is restored. When the problem persists, you should check the throttle position sensor, temperature sensor, lambda probe, sometimes it is enough to clean the throttle valve.If the engine triples, check the ignition coils and injectors and spark plugs. In case of problems with the Vanos system, the engine begins to rumble, power decreases, the speed becomes unstable. In this situation, you need to buy a Vanos repair kit.Motors with high wear are characterized by high oil consumption – up to 1 liter per 1000 km. Even after a major overhaul of the engine, consumption is practically not reduced. It is necessary to check whether the gaskets of the sump and the valve cover are not leaking, also exclude leaks through the oil dipstick. Check the integrity of the expansion tank causing antifreeze leakage. Problems can be caused by crankshaft, camshaft, temperature sensors.The main reason for the failure of reliable S50B30 engines is the age of the power units.\n",
      "The most powerful variant of the S50 was introduced as a replacement for the 3-liter S50EU. This motor was installed on the updated M3 E36 (except for the models for North America and Canada, which were equipped with the S52 engine).The 3.2-liter BMW S50B32 engine was supplied with a new Bi-VANOS valve timing system, the valves were changed (the intake diameter was increased to 35 mm, the outlet diameter remained the same, the valve stem thickness decreased from 7 mm to 6 mm). The two-mass flywheel, the outlet system, and the thicker and shorter inlet have also undergone changes.The main malfunctions in the operation of the S50B32 engine: overheating, increased oil consumption, leaks, problems with the Vanos system, floating speed and air leaks at the intake.The power unit is prone to overheating. If you notice a problem, it is worth checking the condition of the pump, radiator, thermostat. The reasons may be air plugs in the cooling system, as well as a violation of the integrity of the radiator cap.If the engine triples, checking the ignition coils, injectors and spark plugs is required. With unstable speeds, the cause is sought in the idle valve, which may fail. It is enough to carry out cleaning, and the motor will be restored. If the problem persists, inspect the temperature sensor, throttle position sensor, lambda probe, clean the throttle valve.The rattling engine causes the Vanos system to break down. As a result, the engine loses power, the speed becomes unstable. To restore functionality, you will need a vanos repair kit.If you notice an increased oil consumption, check if the gaskets of the valve cover, sump are leaking, exclude leakage through the oil dipstick. The check is necessary for the expansion tank. If it is cracked, antifreeze will leak. Crankshaft, camshaft and coolant temperature sensors break down periodically.\n",
      "The BMW S52B32 engine was intended only for North America, as an alternative to the 3.2-literS50B32. The S52B32US motor was produced from 1995 to 2000, and 37,790 units were produced. The replacement for this motor was the S54B32.Among other problems of the unit stand out: breakage of knee and camshaft sensors, poor cylinder head fastening, thermostat leakage, sensitivity to fuel quality and average resource.\n",
      "The BMW S54B32 engine is a more productive and high-revving version of the engine, in contrast to the S52, which was installed on the BMW M3 in the back of the E46, including the Z3M and Z4M roadsters / coupes.The BMW S54B32 engine became the best engine in the International Powertrain Competition in 2001 in the category “from 3.0 to 4.0 liters”, and every year until 2006 it was recognized as the best in this category. In 2001, he also entered the Ward’s 10 Best Engines list and remained there until the end of 2004.The S version does not have the high oil consumption of the standard M54. However, if such a problem appears, then the reason is the failed valve stem seals or rings. Overheating also sometimes happens. This is due to air locks in the cooling system. Also, the reason may be contamination of the radiator itself, damage to its lid, or problems with the thermostat or pump.The unit of this series has an impressive resource, but at the same time it is necessary to take into account the mode in which the M3 E46 models were often operated. Proceeding from this and from the motor itself, any “surprises” can be expected. For example, after passing M3 an average of 150 thousand km, it is necessary to completely change the timing chain, liners and tensioners. It should be noted that such shortcomings are more typical for copies released before 2003. More modern versions do not suffer from such diseases.Another important fact. If the S54B32 was purchased in good working order, you should not violate the conditions of its operation, especially pouring someone else’s oil and delaying its replacement and, in general, inspection and maintenance.\n",
      "The modernization of the M62 engine led to the creation in 1998 of the improved S62 8-cylinder gasoline engine. The cylinder bore has been increased to 94 mm and the piston stroke is 89 mm. This allowed the total engine displacement to be increased to 4941 cc. The S62 inherited an aluminum engine block and aluminum cylinder heads.For trouble-free operation of the BMW S62 engine, it is necessary to monitor the cooling system and use high-quality working fluids. Among the problems that arise: engine knocking, leaks, unstable rpm.Alarming sounds in the power unit may appear due to the stretching of the timing chain, which has a resource of 200 thousand kilometers. The tensioner bar, the chain bar, the tensioner itself and the Vanos system, which is designed for a similar service life, can fail. Don’t delay checking to avoid big problems.If you notice a leak, check the valve cover gasket. In most cases, replacing the gasket will fix the problem. A bath with a cooling liquid can also leak, in such a situation it is necessary to replace the bath or the intake manifold gasket, check the integrity of the pump.When the revolutions are floating, the reason is often hidden in air leakage in the intake manifold, or in a malfunction of the air flow meter. The appearance of unstable rpm is caused by a faulty crankcase ventilation valve, a breakdown of the throttle position sensors or a clogged throttle valve.Oil consumption begins to increase after 250 thousand kilometers – it is required to replace the valve stem seals. The engine mountings are changed every 200 thousand run.\n",
      "The BMW S63B44 engine is the development of a subsidiary of the BMW carmaker – BMW Motorsport GmbH. It is a variant of the N63 series and was first used in the production of the BMW X6M. The main emphasis of this engine series is placed on economical fuel consumption and high technical characteristics of the unit as a whole.The crossover outlet manifold, the latest Valvetronic system and many other latest developments by BMW engineers have been widely used in the S63.The BMW S63 engine is characterized by the following malfunctions: high oil consumption, water hammer, misfiring.The problem of increased oil consumption is associated with coking of the piston grooves, wear of the rings. The malfunction is eliminated by carrying out a major overhaul with the replacement of the rings. The rapid consumption of oil causes corrosion of alusil, in such a situation, the cylinder block is changed.The turbines are located between the cylinders – there is a high concentration of heat transfer in the collapse of the block. The oil return pipes of the turbines pass here, which coke, and the turbines fail. The high temperature in the breakup negatively affects the vacuum tubes as well as the plastic tubes of the cooling system.If there are dips during ignition, you need to check the candles, if necessary, replace them with similar ones from the M-series.In case of water hammer, the reason lies in the piezo injectors, they need to be replaced.In order to neutralize problems in the process of using the power unit, it is necessary to monitor the condition of the motor and carry out regular maintenance. Worn out components must be replaced in a timely manner in order to avoid serious problems.\n",
      "The BMW S65B40 engine is a V8 naturally aspirated engine with two overhead camshafts (DOHC), 32 valves, which replaced the S54 six-cylinder engine and has been in production since 2007. The BMW S65 is only available on the BMW M3 and has the same bore / stroke as the 10-cylinder S85, but unlike the S85, the VANOS system is driven by oil pressure. The replacement for this power unit was the 6-cylinder – S55.During the operation of the power unit BMW S65 are faced with the problem of rapid wear of the connecting rod bearings – they must be changed every 80 thousand kilometers. To avoid serious damage, it is advisable to replace the liners in advance.Periodic repairs are required for the Vanos system; for this, a repair kit is used. Running problems can lead to engine rattling.The motor works without problems for a long time, subject to regular maintenance, no overheating, timely replacement of worn parts.\n",
      "BMW S85 Engine – V-type 10-cylinder piston engine with two overhead camshafts (DOHC), which replaced the S62 engine, was produced from 2005 to 2010 and was used in BMW E60 M5, E61 M5 and E63/64 M6. The S85B50 engine is high-revving, with a red mark on the 8250 rpm rev counter. It reaches over 100 hp (70 kW) per liter, and has a very high compression ratio of 12.0:1. Its technology is based on the BMW Williams F1 engine.The BMW S85 engine is characterized by premature wear on the connecting rod bearings. Replacement must be done every 80 thousand kilometers. In this case, it is better to change the liners in advance, without waiting for complete wear and tear, in order to prevent breakdowns, the elimination of which will require significant investments.Periodic repairs are necessary for the Vanos system, problems occur infrequently, but require timely elimination. Overheating of the motor should be avoided.With regular diagnostics and maintenance, the powertrain of the BMW S85 will last a long time and without any problems.\n"
